# SeaQL looking forward

SeaQL as it's name suggest, is heavily vested in SQL. But it does not mean that we are not looking forward to new trends in data engineering!

Several ideas we keep our eyes on:

1. Streaming / Real-time data processing, e.g. Kafka, Redpanda
2. Separation of storage and compute, e.g. Presto, Quickwit
